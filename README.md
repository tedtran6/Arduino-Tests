# Arduino-Tests
Several different kinds of tests and experiments on libraries and modules relating to arduino stuff will be hosted here.
Not much is commented, explained, or documented here, because these files are mostly for my own use and benefit.

## another_fan_test
This is a small project I made which uses a regular computer fan as a sensor that can calculate the RPM of the fan.
The calculation that is made translates to different kinds of MIDI output
